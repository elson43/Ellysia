            <p>Hello LanLan!,<br><br>

                I created this website as a way to share some thoughts I’ve had for a while. Things don’t always go as planned, so I decided to send it a little earlier than expected.<br><br>

                I wanted to put my feelings into something meaningful, and this website was my way of doing that. Even though we haven’t really talked, I’ve always appreciated you from afar, and I wanted to express that in a way that feels right.<br><br>

                Learning how to create this took time, but every line of code made me think of you and what might make you smile. It’s my way of sharing a piece of my thoughts with you.<br><br>

                I hope the website isn’t too much of an English test! I tried to keep it simple and easy to read.

    <h2>A Note Just For You</h2>
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <div class="fade-in">
            <p style="text-align:center;">
                Dear Ellysia,<br><br>

                Over time, I’ve come to admire you more than I expected. I just want to be honest with you, no pressure. Seeing you always brightens my day.<br><br>

                It all started one day in the canteen. I remember seeing you laughing with your friends, focused on the work the teacher had given you. You were just enjoying the moment, and I was sitting there trying to eat my lunch. But suddenly, I couldn’t help but notice you.<br><br>

                I noticed you before I even knew who you were. You caught my attention without trying—just the way you moved, the way you smiled, the way you were. There was something about you that stood out, and I couldn’t explain it at first. Even before I knew your name, I found myself looking for you in every room, hoping to see you again. It wasn’t just that you were good-looking, though that was part of it. Something about you made it impossible not to look your way.<br><br>

                This website and these gifts are my way of saying thank you for being you. I’ve always appreciated you, and I genuinely hope you continue to be happy. When you're happy, it makes me happy too, and that’s all I hope for you.<br><br>

                As graduation approaches, I know we may not see each other as much, and that’s okay. I’m ready to move forward, but meeting you has definitely been one of the highlights of high school for me.<br><br>

                I’m sorry if I’ve ever come across as awkward or cringey. This is my first time being open like this, and I really appreciate you understanding. I just wanted you to know that you’ve made a difference.<br>
                Your presence has a way of motivating me to grow and do better, and I really appreciate that.<br><br>

            </p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <div class="fade-in">
            <p>
                I know it might sound silly, but I sometimes catch myself lost in thought about you. Your smile can turn a bad day into a good one, and your laughter brings me a kind of happiness I didn’t know was possible. Just knowing you’re around makes me want to show up, even on the hardest days.<br><br>

                Even when we’re apart, you’re in my thoughts, and I can’t help but smile. Being around you makes me appreciate the little things and see the world in a better way. And though I wish I could tell you all this in person, every time I look into your eyes, my words just disappear.<br><br>

                And about your quirky, weird side—I love it. I didn't expect you to be that much of a freak, but somehow, I find it cute. <br> Like that time you sent the 'cihuuy' sticker for the first time. It was random, but it made me smile. <br> Those little moments are what make you, well, you.

    <h2>Thoughtful Discoveries</h2>
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <div class="fade-in">
            <p>I looked up the meaning of your name out of curiosity. I noticed you go by Lanlan instead of Ellysia, and I think both are cute, but Ellysia has a nice feel to it.<br>
                <br>
                I found out Lanlan means "anggrek flower," which is beautiful—just like the flower itself!<br>
                <br>
                I also found out you like Wanderer from Genshin Impact, and when I saw your profile picture with that scarameow or whatever that black cat called, I went on a research and found one just like it. I thought it might be something you'd love, since you have such good taste in cute things.<br><br>
                Then I found out you like Sanrio characters. <br> Even though I’m not really into that kind of stuff, I ended up looking into the world of Sanrio to see what it’s all about. <br> Now I know a lot more about those characters. <br> It’s still not really my thing, but I ended up appreciating it because it’s something you enjoy!<br>
                <br>
                I picked a bracelet for you, but then I started wondering why you never seem to wear one. I thought maybe it was because of metal allergies, but when you mentioned your allergy to dust, I realized it wasn’t that. Anyway, I bought it anyway—hope you like it!

    <h2>Final thoughts</h2 >
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <div class="fade-in">
            <p>To wrap things up, I just wanted to say that I’ve really enjoyed the small moments, like your smile or just seeing you around. Even though things might not go anywhere, those moments have meant more to me than I expected.<br><br>

                I’ve come to realize that I’m not ready for a relationship, and it’s time for me to let go of any feelings I had. This website is my final gesture—just a little something to show my appreciation. I’m not trying to chase anything; just closing this chapter with a smile.<br><br>
                
                I wish you all the best in everything you do, and I hope you always stay yourself. You’re amazing, and I’ll always be grateful for that.<br><br>
                
                Thanks for taking the time to read this. It means a lot.<br><br>
                
                Take care and keep smiling. Even though we’re still in the same school, this is me stepping back, but I’m wishing you nothing but the best, and yeah<br><br>
                Merry Christmas !
