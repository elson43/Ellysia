            <p>Hey Lanlan,<br><br>
    
                I created this website as a way to share some of my thoughts with you-- thoughts that have grown stronger over time. I wanted to express myself in a way that felt meaningful, and so I decided to make this site for you.<br><br>
                It took me months to finish this because I was learning web development along the way. With every line of code, I found myself thinking about you, wondering what kinds of things you'll like, what makes you smile....<br><br>
                 I wanted it to be something special, something that would show you how much I appreciate you,
                 even if we‚Äôve never really had a conversation hehehe.....<br><br>  
                The process took a while, but it was worth it because I wanted everything to be just right. I hope when you see this, you‚Äôll understand how important this project was for me and how much thought and care I‚Äôve put into it, And by the way<br>
                <br>While creating this website, I kept thinking, "I hope she can read this!" I might accidentally made it a English test instead.<br><br>

        <div class="fade-in">
            <p style="text-align:center;">
                Dear Ellysia,<br><br>
                
                There‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been meaning to tell you,<br> and I want to be honest about it.<br><br>
                
                Over time, I‚Äôve come to admire you more than I expected, and those<br> feelings have only grown stronger.<br><br>
                
                I also know you‚Äôve never liked anyone before, and that‚Äôs something<br> I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about, I want to be clear and<br> not create any confusion or pressure for you.<br><br>
                
                The truth is, I know it‚Äôs not the right time.<br>
                Neither of us is after anything serious right now, <br>but I still wanted you to know how special you are.<br><br>
                You‚Äôve impacted my world in a way I didn‚Äôt expect, and I wanted<br> to share that with you,
                Even though we don‚Äôt talk much,<br> I wanted to do something nice for you.<br><br>
                The website and gifts aren‚Äôt about anything serious,<br> just a way to say thanks for being someone I‚Äôve admired.<br><br>
                I don‚Äôt expect anything, but I hope this little gesture brings a smile.                <br></p>
        
    
        
            <p style="text-align:center;">
                As graduation approaches, I‚Äôve been thinking about the future and how we might not see each other as often.<br><br>
                That thought is bittersweet, but I want you to know that wherever life takes us,
                <br> I‚Äôll always remember how you‚Äôve made my<br> high school experience brighter.<br><br>
            </p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">When It All Began</h2>
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <div class="fade-in">
            <p>
                It all began on a typical day in the canteen.<br>
                I spotted you sitting with your friends, immersed in work and studies assigned by your teacher.<br><br>
                The way you focused, occasionally laughing with your friends, created an atmosphere that was hard to ignore.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In that instant, something sparked within me‚Äîan unexpected crush that took me by surprise.<br>
                Your smile was the highlight of that busy day, and I felt drawn to you in a way I couldn‚Äôt explain.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As time passed, that initial spark blossomed into a genuine admiration.<br>
                I found myself looking forward to seeing you, realizing that your presence had a unique way of brightening my day.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It‚Äôs funny how a simple moment can lead to such deep feelings, but I just wanted you to know that you‚Äôve captured my heart without even trying.<br>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <div class="fade-in">
            <p>
                You make me want to try.<br><br>
                You make me want to stumble through the awkwardness, to push past the discomfort, and find a way to express how much you mean to me.<br><br>
                It‚Äôs not easy, and I might not always get it right, but for you, I‚Äôm willing to try.<br><br>
                Because you deserve to know. You deserve to know how your smile lights up my day. You deserve to know how your kindness has a way of making everything feel lighter and more peaceful.<br><br> So, even though I‚Äôve never been great at telling people how I feel, for you, I want to try. I‚Äôll try to find the right words to show you just how much you brighten my world.<br><br>
                
                When I see you, I feel this rush of warmth that spreads through me, and no matter how hard I try to play it cool, I can‚Äôt stop my lips from curling into a smile.<br><br>
                Even though we haven‚Äôt had the chance to really talk, I‚Äôm genuinely curious about you‚Äîwhat's your hobby and what's your favorite food.<br><br>
                I must admit, I can be a bit shy around you. I often catch myself trying to look in other directions, but I‚Äôm always curious about where you are and what you‚Äôre doing.<br><br>
                I‚Äôve wondered about the things that make you happy and the dreams you hold close to your heart.<br>

    <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <div class="fade-in">
            <p>As I pen down my last thoughts, I want to share<br> how much this memories has meant to me. I‚Äôve cherished every moment,<br> even the silence between us.<br><br>
                If fate allows, I hope you‚Äôll remember me with a smile,<br> and perhaps one day, we can share stories again. Until then, I‚Äôll carry these feelings with me as a beautiful memory,<br> wishing you endless joy and success in everything you pursue.<br><br>
                I hope you chase your dreams fearlessly and find joy in every<br> step of your journey.<br><br>
                While we may not know what the future holds.<br> <br>I hope this website brings a smile to your face,<br> and maybe one day, we can talk more.
                <br><br>
                And Please, take care of yourself.<br> I'll always be cheering for you, even from afar.<br><br>
                Honestly, if we ever meet and you don‚Äôt ask me anything back,<br> I might just start throwing you random question,<br> I'm preparing for the day u'll ask me something like ANYTHING,<br><br> you asking a single question feels like a God's Miracle, anyways<br><br>
                 Merry Christmas!
