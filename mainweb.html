    <h2>Welcome </h2>
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <p>Hey ka_okao07,<br><br>

            I created this website as a way to share some of my thoughts with you-- thoughts that have grown stronger over time. I wanted to express myself in a way that felt meaningful, and so I decided to make this site for you.<br><br>
            It’s taken me months to complete because, honestly, I’ve been learning web development along the way. With every line of code I wrote, I was thinking of you—wondering what you like, what makes you laugh, and what your dreams are. I wanted it to be something special, something that would show you how much I appreciate you,
             even if we’ve never really had a conversation hehehe.....<br><br>  
            The process took a while, but it was worth it because I wanted everything to be just right. I hope when you see this, you’ll understand how important this project was for me and how much thought and care I’ve put into it, And by the way<br>
            <br>While creating this website, I kept thinking, "I hope she can read this!" I might accidentally made it a English test instead.<br><br>
            i hope u can read it tho, i believe u can.

    <h2>A Note Just For You</h2>
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <p style="text-align:center;">
            Dear Ellysia,<br><br>
            
            There’s something I’ve been meaning to tell you, and I want to be honest about it.<br><br>
            
            Over time, I’ve developed feelings for you. You’ve been someone I really admire, and it felt important to let you know that.<br><br>
            
            I also know you’ve never liked anyone before... , and that’s something I’ve been thinking a lot about, I want to be clear and not create any confusion or pressure for you.<br><br>
            
            The truth is, while I care about you and appreciate who you are, I’m not in a place to pursue a relationship right now. I like you, but I want to make sure there are no misunderstandings or false expectations.<br><br>
            
            I just wanted to be open with you and let you know how much you mean to me. I’m not expecting anything from you, and I don’t want to complicate your life.<br><br>
            
            I just thought it was important to express how I feel, while making sure you understand where I stand.<br><br>
            
        </p>
        
        <p style="text-align:center;">
            As I approach graduation and think about the future, I realize how bittersweet it is to know that we might not cross paths again.<br><br>
            
            I want you to know that your smile has been a bright spot in my high school experience.<br><br>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">When It All Began</h2>
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <p>
            It all began on a typical day in the canteen.<br>
            I spotted you sitting with your friends, immersed in work and studies assigned by your teacher.<br><br>
            The way you focused, occasionally laughing with your friends, created an atmosphere that was hard to ignore.<br>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In that instant, something sparked within me—an unexpected crush that took me by surprise.<br>
            Your smile was the highlight of that busy day, and I felt drawn to you in a way I couldn’t explain.<br>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            As time passed, that initial spark blossomed into a genuine admiration.<br>
            I found myself looking forward to seeing you, realizing that your presence had a unique way of brightening my day.<br>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            It’s funny how a simple moment can lead to such deep feelings, but I just wanted you to know that you’ve captured my heart without even trying.
        </p>

    <h2>Funfact</h2>
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <p>
            I often found myself smiling just from seeing you.<br><br>
            Even though we haven’t had the chance to really talk, I’m genuinely curious about you, whats your hobby and what color do you like.<br><br>
            I must admit, I can be a bit shy around you. I often catch myself trying to look in other directions, but I’m always curious about where you are and what you’re doing.<br><br>
            I’ve wondered about the things that make you happy and the dreams you hold close to your heart.<br><br>
            You wont believe how many time i died by just catching a glimpse of that smile<br><br> i might need to check my sugar levels.<br>
