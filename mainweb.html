            <p>Hey Lanlan, <br><br>
                I made this website as a way to share some thoughts that have been on my mind for a while. I wanted to put it into something meaningful, and so, this little site was born! <br><br>
                Learning how to make this took some time, but honestly, every line of code made me think of you and wonder about the little things that make you smile. <br><br>
                I wanted it to be special, a small way of showing how much I appreciate you—even if we haven’t really had a conversation yet. <br><br>
                I hope the website isn’t too much of an English test! I tried my best to make it short and easy to read.<br><br>

    <h2>A Note Just For You</h2>
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <div class="fade-in">
            <p style="text-align:center;">
                Hi Ellysia,<br><br>
                Over time, I’ve come to admire you so much more than I ever expected. And I get that this might sound like a lot, but I’m not here to create pressure—just to be honest. I wanted to let you know how special you are and how seeing you brightens my day every single time.<br><br>

                This website and these gifts are just a way to say thank you for being you!<br><br>All I want is to see you smile—when you’re happy, it makes me happy too.<br>That’s really all I wish for.<br><br>
                As graduation gets closer, I can’t help but think about the future. I know we may not cross paths as often, and it’s a bittersweet thought. I also know I’m not ready to take this further right now, but it doesn’t change the fact that meeting you has made this high school experience so much brighter. These memories, even if we drift apart, will stay with me always.<br><br>

                And I’m really sorry if I’ve ever come across as a bit weird or cringey—I never meant to be. I’m not the best at this, and it’s my first time being open with someone, so thank you for being understanding. I just wanted you to know what a difference you’ve made, and that you’ll always mean something special to me.<br><br>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">When It All Began</h2>
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <div class="fade-in">
            <p>
                It all began on a typical day in the canteen.<br> I spotted you sitting with your friends, immersed in the assignments from your teacher.<br><br> The way you focused, occasionally sharing a laugh with your friends, created an atmosphere that was hard to ignore.<br>

                That day in the canteen, your smile caught my attention and hasn’t left my mind since. It was the highlight of a busy day, drawing me in with a charm I couldn't quite explain.<br><br>

                As time went on, that initial spark transformed into genuine admiration. I found myself looking forward to seeing you, realizing that your presence had a special way of brightening my day.<br>

                It’s funny how a simple moment can lead to deeper feelings. I just wanted you to know that you caught my attention without even trying—just the way you moved, the way you smiled, the way you were.<br><br>

                There was something about you that stood out, and I couldn’t quite explain it at first. I found myself looking for you in every room, hoping to catch a glimpse again, even though I didn’t know anything about you yet. It wasn’t just that you were pretty, though that was certainly part of it.<br><br>

                Even before I knew your name, something about you made it impossible not to glance your way. It’s strange to feel this way about someone you don’t know, but there it is—a gentle pull that keeps drawing me to you.<br>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <div class="fade-in">
            <p>
                I know this might sound stupid, but sometimes I find myself lost in thought about you.<br><br> It’s crazy how a smile can change a bad day into a good one.<br><br> Your laughter makes me happy, and I often wish I could share a moment of joy with you.<br>
                Every time I see you, it reminds me of how much happiness there is in the world.<br><br> Just knowing you’re around motivates me to show up at school, even on the toughest days.<br><br> You inspire me to notice the small things and to be a better person.<br><br> Your presence alone motivates me to push through my challenges and be the best version of myself.<br><br> Even when we’re apart, you’re in my thoughts, and I can’t help but smile.<br>
                So, while this might be awkward to say, I want you to know that you are amazing.<br><br> I may not have the courage to say this face-to-face, because every time I’m near you, my words just disappear.<br><br> The moment I look into your eyes, my mind goes blank, and all my plans to speak somehow vanish.<br><br> Suddenly, I’m just there, lost in your gaze, like it’s a world of its own, and holding back my smile becomes impossible.<br><br> That’s why I keep looking down at my phone when we talk—I’m sorry if it seems distant, but honestly, I just can’t keep the conversation going if I meet your eyes.<br>
                And I love your quirky side—like that first time you sent the 'cihuuy' sticker on WhatsApp.<br><br> It made me smile and think, 'She’s so wonderfully weird, and I love it.

    <h2>A Little Investigation</h2>
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <div class="fade-in">
            <p>You've been on my mind a lot lately, so I couldn’t help but investigate the meaning behind your name. There’s got to be something special about it! Why do you go by Lanlan instead of Ellysia? Don’t get me wrong—Lanlan is cute, but Ellysia has that vibe straight out of fairy-tale.<br><br>

                Speaking of names, I found out that Lanlan means 'anggrek flower,' and I can’t even be mad about it—anggreks are stunning! Whoever came up with that name is brilliant.<br><br>
                
                I've also been trying to figure out what your favorite dolls are. I keep thinking, “Is it this Sanrio character or that one?” Honestly, I’m so confused! I just want to get it right because I know you have great taste in cute things.<br><br>
                
                Now, about the necklace I picked out for you—I was a bit nervous wondering if you might be allergic to metal since I’ve never seen you wear any jewelry. So, I finally asked, and you told me you’re allergic… to dust! I couldn’t help but laugh! Dust allergies are definitely a thing, but that caught me completely off guard.<br><br>
                
                So, no need to worry about the necklace—I’m relieved it’s not a serious metal allergy. Just keep it away from dusty places, okay? 😊

    <h2>Final thoughts</h2 >
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <div class="fade-in">
            <p>Wrapping this all up, I just wanted to say that having these moments with you—even just the little smiles, quick glances and simple exchanges—has meant a lot to me.<br><br>

                I hope this website made you smile, and maybe someday, we’ll look back on all of this and laugh about it.<br><br>
                
                As we move forward, I genuinely wish you all the best with everything you do. Chase your dreams, keep shining, and stay as amazing as you are.<br><br>
                
                I’ll always be here cheering for you, and who knows—maybe one day I’ll finally get to ask you all those random questions that keep popping into my mind!<br><br>
                
                Thanks for reading through my thoughts—it honestly means a lot.<br><br>
                
                Merry Christmas, and don't forget to keep smiling! 🎄 <br><br>   -Elson
