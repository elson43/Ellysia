            <p>Hey Lanlan,<br><br>
    
                I created this website as a way to share some of my thoughts with you-- thoughts that have grown stronger over time. I wanted to express myself in a way that felt meaningful, and so I decided to make this site for you.<br><br>
                It took me months to finish this because I was learning web development along the way. With every line of code, I found myself thinking about you, wondering what kinds of things you'll like, what makes you smile....<br><br>
                 I wanted it to be something special, something that would show you how much I appreciate you,
                 even if we‚Äôve never really had a conversation...<br><br>  
                The process took a while, but it was worth it because I wanted everything to be just right. I hope when you see this, you‚Äôll understand how important this project was for me and how much thought and care I‚Äôve put into it, And by the way<br>
                <br>I hope this website isn‚Äôt turning into an English test for you! I really tried to make it easy to read.<br><br>

            <p style="text-align:center;">
                Dear Ellysia,<br><br>
                
                There‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been meaning to tell you,<br> and I want to be honest about it.<br><br>
                
                Over time, I‚Äôve come to admire you more than I expected, and those<br> feelings have only grown stronger.<br><br>
                
                I also know you‚Äôve never liked anyone before, and that‚Äôs something<br> I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about, I want to be clear and<br> not create any confusion or pressure for you.<br><br>
                
                The truth is, I know it‚Äôs not the right time.<br>
                Neither of us is after anything serious right now, <br>but I still wanted you to know how special you are.<br><br>
                You‚Äôve impacted my world in a way I didn‚Äôt expect, and I wanted<br> to share that with you,
                Even though we don‚Äôt talk much,<br> I wanted to do something nice for you.<br><br>
                These gifts and the website aren‚Äôt meant to push any serious thoughts, but simply to say thank you for being someone who brightens my day.<br><br>
                I don‚Äôt expect anything, but I hope this little gesture brings a smile.                <br></p>
        
    
        
            <p style="text-align:center;">
                As graduation gets closer, I‚Äôve been thinking about the future and how we might not see each other as often.<br><br>
                That thought is bittersweet, but I want you to know that wherever life takes us,
                <br> I‚Äôll always remember how you‚Äôve made my<br> high school experience brighter.<br><br>
            </p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">When It All Began</h2>
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <div class="fade-in">
            <p>
                It all began on a typical day in the canteen.<br>
                I spotted you sitting with your friends, immersed in work and studies assigned by your teacher.<br><br>
                The way you focused, occasionally laughing with your friends, created an atmosphere that was hard to ignore.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                That day in the canteen, I couldn‚Äôt stop noticing your smile. Since then, you‚Äôve been on my mind.<br>
                Your smile was the highlight of that busy day, and I felt drawn to you in a way I couldn‚Äôt explain.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As time passed, that initial spark blossomed into a genuine admiration.<br>
                I found myself looking forward to seeing you, realizing that your presence had a unique way of brightening my day.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It‚Äôs funny how a simple moment can lead to such deep feelings, but I just wanted you to know that you caught my attention without even trying--just the way you moved, the way you smiled, the way you were.<br><br>
                There was something about you that stood out. i couldn't explain it at first. I just found myself looking for you in every room, hoping i'd see you again.<br> even though i didn't know anything about you yet. It wasn't just<br> that you were pretty, though that was part of it.<br>
                <br> I had my eyes on you even before i knew your name. it's strange, feeling that way about someone you don't know.<br><br>
                Even before i knew your name, something about you made it impossible not to look your way.
            </p>
        </div>

    <h2>Mystery of Your Name</h2>
    <div  class="box" id="message">
        <div class="fade-in">
        <p>You‚Äôve been on my mind so much lately that I started wondering about your name.<br>
            I thought, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs got to be something special there, right?‚Äù<br>
            So, like any curious person, I went on a mini detective mission and even consulted ChatGPT to figure out what hidden meaning your name holds.<br><br>
            
            But it didn‚Äôt stop there.<br>
            I started thinking about all the little things‚Äîlike, what‚Äôs your go-to comfort food?<br>
            What do you love doing in your free time?<br>
            I guess I‚Äôve been quietly piecing together the puzzle that is you.<br><br>
            
            And then, I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder‚Äîwhy do you go by Lanlan instead of Ellysia?<br>
            Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Lanlan is cute, but Ellysia<br> sparkles with elegance, like a name straight from a fairy tale.
            Now that name sounds so elegant, it practically sparkles.<br><br>
            
            Then I found out that Lanlan means 'anggrek flower,' and honestly, I can‚Äôt even be mad about it.<br>
            Anggreks are beautiful too, so my brain was like, ‚ÄúDamn, her parents pulled a brilliant move with that name!‚Äù<br><br>
            
            In any case, you definitely bring a bit of extra light wherever you go‚Äîlike a walking ray of sunshine.<br>
            Seriously, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the sun is taking notes.

                You make me want to try.<br><br>

                It‚Äôs not easy, and I might not always get it right, but for you, I‚Äôm willing to try.<br><br>
                Because you deserve to know. You deserve to know how your smile lights up my day. You deserve to know how your kindness has a way of making everything feel lighter and more peaceful.<br><br> So, even though I‚Äôve never been great at telling people how I feel, for you, I want to try. I‚Äôll try to find the right words to show you just how much you brighten my world.<br><br>
                
                When I see you, I feel this rush of warmth that spreads through me, and no matter how hard I try to play it cool, I can‚Äôt stop my lips from curling into a smile.<br><br>
                Even though we haven‚Äôt had the chance to really talk, I‚Äôm genuinely curious about you‚Äîwhat's your hobby and what's your favorite food.<br><br>
                I must admit, I can be a bit shy around you. I often catch myself trying to look in other directions, but I‚Äôm always curious about where you are and what you‚Äôre doing.<br><br>
                I‚Äôve wondered about the things that make you happy and the dreams you hold close to your heart.<br><br>
                I remember seeing you at a school event once, and though we didn‚Äôt talk, you seemed so happy. It made me realize how much I enjoy seeing you smile.<br>
