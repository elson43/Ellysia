        <div class="fade-in">
            <p>Hello LanLan!, <br><br>
                I made this website as a way to share some thoughts that have been on my mind for a while. I decided to send this a little early because, well, things don‚Äôt always go as planned.<br><br>
                I wanted to share my thoughts with you now,
                I wanted to put it into something meaningful, and so, this little site was born! <br><br>
                Learning how to make this took some time,  but every line of code made me think of you and wonder what makes you smile. Even if we haven‚Äôt really talked, this is my way of showing how much I appreciate you. <br><br>
                I hope the website isn‚Äôt too much of an English test! I tried to make it short and easy to read.<br><br>

    <h2>A Note Just For You</h2>
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <div class="fade-in">
            <p style="text-align:center;">
                Dear, Ellysia<br><br>
                Over time, I‚Äôve come to admire you so much more than I ever expected. I just want to be honest, no pressure. Seeing you brightens my day every single time.<br><br>

                This website and these gifts are just a way to say thank you for being you! All I want is to see you smile‚Äîwhen you‚Äôre happy, it makes me happy too. That‚Äôs really all I wish for.<br><br>

                As graduation gets closer, I think about the future, knowing we may not cross paths as often. It‚Äôs a bittersweet thought. I may not be ready to take this further, but meeting you has made high school unforgettable.<br><br>

                I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôve ever come across as a bit awkward or cringey. It‚Äôs my first time being open like this, so thank you for being understanding. I just wanted you to know what a difference you‚Äôve made.
            </p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">When It All Began</h2>
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <div class="fade-in">
            <p>
                It all began one day in the canteen. I saw you with friends, focused on an assignment, sharing a laugh here and there. Your smile caught my attention, and since then, it‚Äôs been on my mind. It‚Äôs funny how a small moment turned into something meaningful.<br><br>

                Even before I knew your name, I kept hoping to catch a glimpse of you. It wasn‚Äôt just that you were pretty; there was something about you that drew me in.
            </p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <div class="fade-in">
            <p>
                I know it might sound silly, but I sometimes catch myself lost in thought about you. Your smile can turn a bad day into a good one, and your laughter brings me a kind of happiness I didn‚Äôt know was possible. Just knowing you‚Äôre around makes me want to show up, even on the hardest days.<br><br>

                Even when we‚Äôre apart, you‚Äôre in my thoughts, and I can‚Äôt help but smile. Being around you makes me appreciate the little things and see the world in a better way. And though I wish I could tell you all this in person, every time I look into your eyes, my words just disappear.<br><br>

                And your quirky side? I love it‚Äîlike that time you sent the 'cihuuy' sticker. It‚Äôs those unexpected moments that make you so wonderful.

    <h2>A Little Investigation</h2>
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <div class="fade-in">
            <p>You've been on my mind a lot, so I had to look up the meaning of your name. Why do you go by Lanlan instead of Ellysia? I think both are cute, but Ellysia has that fairy-tale charm.

                I found out that Lanlan means 'anggrek flower,' which is beautiful‚Äîanggreks are stunning! Whoever gave you that name is really clever.
                
                I've also been trying to figure out what your favorite characters are. I keep thinking, ‚ÄúIs it this Sanrio character or that one?‚Äù I want to get it right because I know you have great taste in cute things.
                
                I even looked for your favorite doll to pick something you'd really love. When I chose the necklace, I was a bit worried about metal allergies since I hadn‚Äôt seen you wear any jewelry before. But when you told me you‚Äôre allergic to dust, I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh! Just keep it dust-free, okay? üòä
                
                No worries about the necklace; I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs not a serious allergy. Just remember to keep it away from dusty places!

    <h2>Final thoughts</h2 >
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <div class="fade-in">
            <p>To wrap things up, I just want to say that every moment with you‚Äîthose little smiles and simple exchanges‚Äîhas meant so much to me.<br><br>

                I hope this website made you smile, and who knows, maybe one day we can look back and laugh about it.<br><br>
                
                As we move forward, I genuinely wish you all the best. Keep chasing your dreams and shining bright; you're amazing just the way you are.<br><br>
                
                I'll always be cheering for you, and I hope one day I can ask you all those random questions floating in my mind!<br><br>
                
                Thanks for taking the time to read through my thoughts‚Äîit really means a lot.<br><br>
                
                Happy early Christmas, and remember to keep smiling! üéÑ<br><br>
                
                Please don‚Äôt feel like this confession is something heavy. I truly hope we can stay friends, but if it feels overwhelming, that‚Äôs completely okay too.
