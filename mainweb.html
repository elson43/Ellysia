        <div class="fade-in">
            <p>Hello LanLan!,<br><br>
                I created this website to share some thoughts I've had for a while. Things don’t always go as planned, so I decided to send the gifts and this website a bit earlier than expected.<br><br>

                Even though we haven't talked much, I've always admired you from afar, and I wanted to put that into something that felt right.<br><br>

                Learning how to make this website took time, but every step made me think about you and what might make you smile. It’s just my way of sharing some of my thoughts with you.<br><br>

                I hope the website isn’t too much of an English test! I tried to keep it simple, to the point and easy to read.

    <h2>A Note Just For You</h2>
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <div class="fade-in">
            <p style="text-align:center;">
                I’ve come to admire you more than I expected, and I just want to be honest with you—no pressure. Seeing you always brightens my day.<br><br>

                It all started one day in the canteen. I saw you laughing with your friends, focused on your work from your teacher. You were just enjoying the moment, and for some reason I couldn’t help but notice you.<br><br>

                I noticed you before I even knew who you were. The way you talk, the way you smiled—there was something about you that stood out. Even before I knew your name, I found myself looking for you, hoping to see you again. It wasn’t just about how you looked, though that was part of it. There was something about you that made it hard not to look your way.<br><br>

                This website and the gifts are my way of saying thank you for being you and I hope you enjoy it. When you're happy, it makes my day better.<br><br>

                As graduation gets closer, I know we may not see each other much, and that’s totally okay. Meeting you has definitely been one of the best parts of high school for me.<br><br>

                I hope this doesn't come across too awkward or cringy. This is my first time being open like this, and I appreciate you understanding. I just wanted you to know that meeting you has meant something.<br>

    <h2>Dumb Thoughts</h2>
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <div class="fade-in">
            <p>
                I know this sounds stupid, but Sometimes I catch myself thinking about you, and it always puts me in a good mood. Your smile can turn a bad day into a good one, and hearing you laugh just makes me feel happier. Knowing you're around makes even tough days easier.<br><br>
                Sometimes you're on my mind, and for some reason it brings a smile to my face. Being around you makes things suddenly better. I’d like to say this in person, but i don't know why, when I see you, I can’t think of any words.<br><br>
                Oh yea, about that time when you send me the "cihuuy" sticker for the first time.<br> i didn't expect you to be so weird and random                 
                —it was unexpected and it made me laugh. It’s those little things that make you so wonderful, and I love it.<br>

    <h2>Thoughtful Discoveries</h2>
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <div class="fade-in">
            <p>A few weeks ago, I looked up the meaning of your name because i was curious. I noticed you go by Lanlan instead of Ellysia, and I think both are cute, but Ellysia has a nice vibes to it.<br><br>

                Then after some research, I found out that Lanlan means "anggrek flower," which is beautiful—just like the flower itself.<br><br>
                
                then I also saw you like Kazuha and Wanderer from Genshin Impact, and when I saw your profile picture with that black cat (scarameow, or whatever it’s called), I did some research and found one just like it. I thought it might be something you'd love since you have great taste in cute things.<br><br>
                
                Then I found out you like Sanrio characters. Even though I’m not really into that "cute" stuff, I looked into it to see what it’s all about. Now I know more about those characters, and to be honest I still don't know which one is your favorite (i think you liked them all), And it's not really my thing but I ended up liking it because it’s something you enjoy.<br>

    <h2>Final thoughts</h2 >
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <div class="fade-in">
            <p>To wrap things up, I just wanted to say that I’ve really enjoyed the small moments, like your smile or just seeing you around. Even though things might not go anywhere, those moments have meant more to me than I expected.<br><br>

                I’ve come to realize that I’m not ready for a relationship, and it’s time for me to let go of any feelings I had. This website is my final gesture—just a little project to show my appreciation. I’m not trying to chase anything; just closing this chapter with a smile.<br><br>
                
                I wish you all the best in everything you do, and I hope you always be yourself. You’re amazing, and I’ll always be grateful for that.<br><br>
                
                Thanks for reading through this --It really means a lot.<br><br>
                
                Keep chasing your dreams and take care. Even though we’re still in the same school, this is me stepping back, but I’m wishing you nothing but the best, and yeah<br><br>
                Merry Christmas !!
