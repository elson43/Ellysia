            <p>Hey ka_okao07,<br><br>
    
                I created this website as a way to share some of my thoughts with you-- thoughts that have grown stronger over time. I wanted to express myself in a way that felt meaningful, and so I decided to make this site for you.<br><br>
                It’s taken me months to complete because, honestly, I’ve been learning web development along the way. With every line of code I wrote, I was thinking of you—wondering what you like, what makes you laugh, and what your dreams are. I wanted it to be something special, something that would show you how much I appreciate you,
                 even if we’ve never really had a conversation hehehe.....<br><br>  
                The process took a while, but it was worth it because I wanted everything to be just right. I hope when you see this, you’ll understand how important this project was for me and how much thought and care I’ve put into it, And by the way<br>
                <br>While creating this website, I kept thinking, "I hope she can read this!" I might accidentally made it a English test instead
                <br><br>(btw i plan to make the gifts anonymous but i think its already too late for that)<br><br>

                Dear Ellysia,<br><br>
                
                There’s something I’ve been meaning to tell you, and I want to be honest about it.<br><br>
                
                Over time, I’ve come to admire you more than I expected, and those feelings have only grown stronger.<br><br>
                
                I also know you’ve never liked anyone before... , and that’s something I’ve been thinking a lot about, I want to be clear and not create any confusion or pressure for you.<br><br>
                
                The truth is, I know it’s not the right time.<br>
                I’m not in a place to pursue a relationship right now, but I still wanted you to know how special you are.<br><br>
                You’ve impacted my world in a way I didn’t expect, and I wanted to share that with you,<br>
                even if I remain just a quiet admirer.
                .<br></p>

                As graduation approaches, I’ve been thinking about the future and how we might not see each other as often.<br><br>
                That thought is bittersweet, but I want you to know that wherever life takes us,
                 I’ll always remember how you’ve made my high school experience brighter.<br><br>
            </p>

    <div class="box" id="message">
        <div class="fade-in">
            <p>
                It all began on a typical day in the canteen.<br>
                I spotted you sitting with your friends, immersed in work and studies assigned by your teacher.<br><br>
                The way you focused, occasionally laughing with your friends, created an atmosphere that was hard to ignore.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In that instant, something sparked within me—an unexpected crush that took me by surprise.<br>
                Your smile was the highlight of that busy day, and I felt drawn to you in a way I couldn’t explain.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As time passed, that initial spark blossomed into a genuine admiration.<br>
                I found myself looking forward to seeing you, realizing that your presence had a unique way of brightening my day.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It’s funny how a simple moment can lead to such deep feelings, but I just wanted you to know that you’ve captured my heart without even trying.

                When theres a moment our eyes meet, my heart skips a beat.<br>I feel this rush of warmth that spreads through me, and no matter how hard I try to play it cool, I can’t stop my<br> lips from curling into a smile.<br><br> 
                Even though we haven’t had the chance to really talk, I’m genuinely curious about you, whats your hobby and whats your favorite color.<br><br>
                I must admit, I can be a bit shy around you. I often catch myself trying to look in other directions, but I’m always curious about where you are and what you’re doing.<br><br>
                I’ve wondered about the things that make you happy and the dreams you hold close to your heart.<br><br>
    
                You won't believe how many time i died by just catching a glimpse of that smile<br><br> i might need to check my sugar levels.<br><br>

    <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
    <div class="box" id="message">
        <p>As I pen down my last thoughts, I want to share how much this journey has meant to me. I’ve cherished every moment, even the silence between us. It's bittersweet, knowing that my feelings have grown deeper while we’ve drifted apart. My heart aches with the realization that I may be the only one holding on to this connection.
            <br><br>
            If fate allows, I hope you’ll remember me with a smile, and perhaps one day, we can share stories again. Until then, I’ll carry these feelings with me as a beautiful memory, wishing you endless joy and success in everything you pursue. You deserve the world.
            <br><br>
            Please, take care of yourself. I'll always be cheering for you, even from afar.</p>
